# ws scrcpy

Web client for [Genymobile/scrcpy][scrcpy] and more.

## Requirements

Browser must support the following technologies:
* WebSockets
* Media Source Extensions and h264 decoding;
* WebWorkers
* WebAssembly

Server:
* Node.js v10+
* node-gyp ([installation](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation))
* `adb` executable must be available in the PATH environment variable

Device:
* Android 5.0+ (API 21+)
* Enabled [adb debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#Enabling)
* On some devices, you also need to enable
[an additional option](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/issues/70#issuecomment-373286323)
to control it using keyboard and mouse.

## Build and Start

Make sure you have installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/),
[node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) and
[build tools](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)
```shell
git clone https://github.com/NetrisTV/ws-scrcpy.git
cd ws-scrcpy

## For stable version find latest tag and switch to it:
# git tag -l
# git checkout vX.Y.Z

npm install
npm start
```

## Supported features

### Screen casting
The modified [version][fork] of [Genymobile/scrcpy][scrcpy] used to stream
H264-video, which then decoded by one of included decoders:

* MsePlayer, formerly "native" ([code](/src/app/player/MsePlayer.ts)). Based on
[xevokk/h264-converter][xevokk/h264-converter]. TL;DR. HTML5 Video.<br>
Requires [Media Source API][MSE] and `video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E"`
[support][isTypeSupported]. Creates mp4 containers from NALU, received from a
device, then feeds them to [MediaSource][MediaSource]. In theory, it can use
hardware acceleration.
* BroadwayPlayer ([code](/src/app/player/BroadwayPlayer.ts)). Based on
[mbebenita/Broadway][broadway] and [131/h264-live-player][h264-live-player].<br>
Requires [WebAssembly][wasm] and preferably [WebGL][webgl] support.
* TinyH264Player ([code](/src/app/player/TinyH264Player.ts)). Based on
[udevbe/tinyh264][tinyh264].<br>
Requires [WebAssembly][wasm], [WebWorkers][workers], [WebGL][webgl] support.

### Remote control
* Touch events (including multi-touch)
* Multi-touch emulation: <kbd>CTRL</kbd> to start with center at the center of
the screen, <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>CTRL</kbd> to start with center at the
current point
* Capturing keyboard events
* Injecting text (ASCII only)
* Copy to/from device clipboard
* Device "rotation"

### File push
Drag & drop an APK file to push it to the `/data/local/tmp` directory. You can
install it manually from the included [xtermjs/xterm.js][xterm.js] terminal
emulator (see below).

### Remote shell
Control your device from `adb shell` in your browser.

### Debug WebPages/WebView
[/docs/Devtools.md](/docs/Devtools.md)

## Known issues

* The server on the Android Emulator listens on the internal interface and not
available from the outside. Select `proxy over adb` from the list of interfaces.
* TinyH264Player may fail to start, try to reload the page.
* MsePlayer reports too many dropped frames in quality statistics: needs
further investigation.

## Security warning
Be advised and keep in mind:
* There is no encryption between browser and node.js server (plain HTTP).
* There is no encryption between browser and WebSocket server (plain WS).
* There is no authorization on any level.
* The modified version of scrcpy with integrated WebSocket server is listening
for connections on all network interfaces.
* The modified version of scrcpy will keep running after the last client
disconnected.

## WS QVH
This project also contains front-end for
[NetrisTV/ws-qvh](https://github.com/NetrisTV/ws-qvh) - application for screen
streaming and control of iOS devices in a browser.

Run this to build it:

```shell script
npm install
npm run dist:qvhack:frontend
```
